## 🧠 How it works (simplified)

The app runs quietly in the background and:
- Detects when a game is launched on **GeForce NOW**  
- Matches it with a built-in game list  
- Sends the correct **Rich Presence** to Discord  
- Updates it automatically as long as the game is running  

It’s 100% automatic — no need to configure anything.

## 🪄 Tray Icon Options

When running, the app shows an icon in your Windows tray (bottom-right corner).  
From there, you can:
- 🎮 **Force Game** — manually choose which game to display  
- 🔄 **Restart Detection** — refresh the current session  
- 🚀 **Open GeForce NOW**  
- ❌ **Exit the app**
